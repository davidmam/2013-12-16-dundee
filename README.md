## Etherpad

We'll be using an [Etherpad](https://etherpad.mozilla.org/swcexeter) to provide additional 
information on the day. This will be made public on the day.

## Hints and tips

[Hints and tips](HintsAndTips.md) on common Bash and editor commands.

## Before you arrive...

We recommend that you bring your own laptop to work on (so 
that you can easily continue to use the same tools after the 
bootcamp) but we hope to have a handful of backup laptops 
available. If you choose to bring your own laptop then, before 
you arrive, you will need to ensure you have installed and tested
some software. Please see our [set-up page](Setup.md) for a list of the 
software required and instructions.

You should test your installation using our testing scripts described 
[here](setup/README.md). To access these start a shell and run the 
commands:

    git clone --branch 2013-11-exeter --single-branch  https://github.com/swcarpentry/boot-camps
    cd boot-camps/setup

before following [these instructions](setup/README.md).

You also need to create a free individual account on 
[BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/account/signup/). Make sure 
you know your username and password when you arrive

We recommend that you to work through this short tutorial on 
[Beginning Python](http://chryswoods.com/beginning_python) before the
bootcamp. This is designed for people completely new to Python (the main
language used for the programming parts of the bootcamp) and some 
familiarity with the basic syntax will be helpful.  

## Organiser and instructors

The organiser of this boot camp is Konrad Paszkiewicz. The instructors will be David Martin and Christopher Woods.
