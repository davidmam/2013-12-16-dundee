# Martin Jones

## Bio
Martin started his programming career by learning Perl during the course of his PhD in evolutionary biology, and started teaching other people to program soon after. Since then he has taught introductory programming to many biologists, from undergraduates to PIs, and has maintained a philosophy that programming courses must be friendly, approachable, and practical. 


Martin has taught introductory programming as part of the Bioinformatics MSc course at Edinburgh University for the past five years, and is currently Lecturer in Bioinformatics.


Martin's Python teaching materials, including a freely downloadable introductory Python ebook, can be found at [Python for Biologists](http://pythonforbiologists.com)
